📱 SwiftUI Professional Demo Project

I've created a comprehensive SwiftUI demo project that showcases professional iOS development practices. This project demonstrates clean architecture, protocol-oriented design, reactive programming with Combine, and robust testing strategies—making it an ideal reference for scalable, maintainable SwiftUI applications.

🏗️ Architecture & Patterns Implemented
1. MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator)
    Clear separation of concerns
    Coordinators manage navigation logi
    ViewModels encapsulate business logic and app state
    Views are strictly for UI presentation

2. Dependency Injection
    Protocol-based injection via initializers
    Centralized DependencyContainer handles object creation and lifetime
    Enables mocking and unit testing

3. Clean Architecture with Use Cases
    Domain Layer: Core business entities like User
    Use Case Layer: Encapsulates business rules (e.g., UserUseCase)
    Data Layer: Handles API and persistence responsibilities

4. Protocol-Oriented Programming
    All major components are defined by protocols first
    Promotes flexibility, testability, and scalability
    Follows the interface segregation principle

5. SOLID Principles Applied
    SRP: Single Responsibility per component
    OCP: Open/Closed design via protocols
    LSP: Substitutable implementations for testing and reuse
    ISP: Modular, focused interfaces
    DIP: Inversion of dependencies using abstractions

🚀 Key Features

✅ Reactive Programming: Powered by Combine for seamless data flow
❌ Error Handling: Centralized and extensible via NetworkError
🌐 Networking: Generic, protocol-oriented network layer
🧭 Navigation: Decoupled with the Coordinator pattern
🎨 Reusable UI Components: Modular, scalable SwiftUI views
♻️ Memory Management: Proper handling of AnyCancellable subscriptions

🧪 Testing
📦 Complete unit test suite with mock-based architecture
✅ Tests for both use cases and view models
🧪 XCTest expectations for async Combine pipelines
🔁 Follows best practices: clear setup/teardown, isolated tests
